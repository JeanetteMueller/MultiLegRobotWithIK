# Multi-leg Robot with invers kinematic
Robot base to develop a multi legged Robot (3-n) with invers kinematic.
Software is made for EPS32 Dev Boards and an iBus-RC-Reciever like FlySky.

## Build your own
### Stuff to buy
* 15 * ST3020 Servomotors
* Servo Controller board
* ESP32 Dev Board
* FlySky 6/10 Channel Remote + Reciever

### 3D printing
Inside of the STL Folder you find files for 3D printing.
At the end of the filename you find a "x5" orsimilar. So you have to print this part 5 times.

### Prepare the Servos
Use my programmer 
https://github.com/JeanetteMueller/SerialServoIdProgrammer
to set all the 1-n ids.
